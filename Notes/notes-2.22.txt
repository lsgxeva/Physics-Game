beej's guide -- more inspirational instead of what we really need

so undo what we have. 

step-- get chat client working.

factor then wrap it to hide away the syntax so things look nice.

then rewrite chat function.
this should be an ECHO CLIENT


then MULTICHAT
	so many people have this option.


then, single player physics.
first just revieve pysics.
then add sending physics calls


NEXT progress to multiple person physics
	array of file descriptors.
	
	server data structure saying who is who.
		hash table (from gtk) to connect file descriptors and usernames

select stuff should be HIDDEN AWAY

USE TELNET AS THE CLIENT FOR NOW
	alternative: send a file
		write a simple server which connects and sends a file across.
			could use stdin (pipe to std in.)


PROTOCOL 
	balcom says YOU MUST USE ASCII
	ints gets shui COMPLICATED
	ascii is printable to files and stuff like that
	this means parsing but i guess thats ok...


IN WORLD PHYSICS LOAD STAR:
	pound define an array of doubles to represent star angles.
